## Information Collection and Use

### Data processed by the Unecm
Unecm is a simple utility application designed to decompress ECM (Error Code Modeler) disk image files.

- The App processes **only the file explicitly selected by the user**
- All decompression operations are performed **locally on the device**
- **No files or personal data are transmitted** by the App to external servers
- The App does **not collect, store, or share** personal user data by itself

---

## Advertising (Google AdMob)

The App displays interstitial advertisements provided by **Google AdMob**.

AdMob may collect and process certain information automatically, such as:
- Device information (e.g. device identifiers)
- Approximate location
- Advertising interaction data

This data is collected **by Google**, not by the developer of Unecm, and is used to provide and improve advertising services.

For more information on how Google handles data, please refer to:

## Analytics

The developer uses **default Google Play Console analytics** provided by Google to understand general app performance and usage (such as installs, crashes, and aggregated usage statistics).

No custom analytics or tracking systems are implemented within the App itself.

---

## Data Sharing
Unecm does **not** share any personal data directly.

Data collected by third-party services (such as Google AdMob) is handled according to their respective privacy policies.

---

## Children’s Privacy
Unecm does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.  
If you believe that a child has provided personal information through third-party services used by the App, please contact the developer.
